2) Adjust next.config.mjs - In the case of TypeScript related changes: The `tsconfig.json` is used to compile your source code in a single JavaScript bundle, which can be served as static files from any web server configured Firebase Hosting or other similar environments (i.e., rewrites). Suggested change would involve ensuring all paths within tsconfig.json are correctly relative and absolute for NextJS's client side routing to not passed down into the firebasestorage bucket, if there is one otherwise it should be left as-is serve them from serverless functions or static files only when needed by your project’s routing configuration in nextjs (i.e., rewrites).
3) In case you have any custom domain setup on Google Cloud Storage - The `firebasestorage` link is used to get download URL of the necessary assets such as JavaScript, CSS and images which can be served from Firebase Hosting or other similar environments only when needed by your project’s routing configuration within NextJS (i.e., rewrites).
4) If all else fails - Consider using a different serverless framework like Vercel or Netlify to meet deployments on Google Cloud Storage(Firebasestorage), in such cases, you can use the `next build` command followed by serving from dist directory (i.e., rewrites).
