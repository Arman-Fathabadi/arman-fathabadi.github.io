import { useRouter } from 'next/router' // import this if you are not already doing so... 
const router = useRouter()      and then call it like  `{router.push('/about')}(adjust as per requirement...)  `    or `use Routes hooks to navigate links in your components.. (like <Link href="/">Home</link>`)    ```
